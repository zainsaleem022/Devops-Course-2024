# **A Guide to My DevOps Learning Journey**

Starting in DevOps with little prior experience, I’ve now gained a solid foundation in key tools and practices through my recent classes. Here’s an overview of what I’ve covered:

## 🐳 Docker
Docker has introduced me to containerization, showing me how applications can be consistently packaged and deployed across various environments. This is foundational in modern application deployment and scaling.

## ☸️ Kubernetes
Kubernetes taught me the essentials of container orchestration, enabling the management of applications across clusters. Working with Kubernetes has helped me understand the mechanics behind scaling and automating application deployment.

## ⚙️ Knative
Knative introduced me to deploying serverless workloads on Kubernetes, making it easier to run and scale containerized applications in an event-driven way.

## 🔒 Kyverno
With Kyverno, I learned about policy management for Kubernetes, gaining insights into security and compliance by setting up policies that automate best practices within clusters.

## 🤖 GitHub Actions
GitHub Actions provided me with hands-on experience in continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD). Automating processes like building, testing, and deploying code has shown me the value of efficient workflows in a development environment.

## 🧩 Istio Service Mesh
I explored Istio to understand service-to-service communication in Kubernetes environments. Istio’s traffic management and security features have been invaluable in controlling and securing microservices communication.

## 🌍 Terraform
Terraform introduced me to infrastructure as code, a powerful concept for automating and managing cloud resources. Using configuration files, I learned how to create, change, and improve infrastructure with minimal manual intervention.

## 📦 Helm Charts
Lastly, Helm taught me to package and deploy applications in Kubernetes through reusable charts. Helm streamlines complex deployments and ensures configurations are standardized across environments.
